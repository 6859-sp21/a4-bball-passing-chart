        <h2 class="page-sub-header">We dissected the 2015-2016 NBA season and asked: given a player with the ball in a
            certain location on the court, what comes next?</h2>

        <p>NBA players and do one of 3 things with a basketball: (1) dribble, (2) pass, and (3) shoot. While many
            existing
            visualizations effectively depict shot percentages, few explore ball movement. Here, we take a closer look
            at
            ball movement through the lens of passes and shot percentages. Click a spot on the court below, and see the
            heat
            map of possible pass locations. Click <a id="reset-button">here</a> to reset the data (and see a heatmap of
            pass start locations).
